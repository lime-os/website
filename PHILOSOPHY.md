LimeOS is built on the belief that software should be clear, trustworthy, and built to last. Its philosophy centers on four core virtues: Logic, Integrity, Minimalism, and Endurance. These guide decisions and promote lasting, resilient design. In classical philosophy, a virtue is a quality that shapes action toward a lasting good. In LimeOS, each virtue serves as a compass when making tradeoffs.

**Important:** This philosophy is replicated across _all_ LimeOS repositories. Any changes made here must also be applied to the `PHILOSOPHY.md` files across other repositories to maintain consistency.

## The Four Virtues

### Logic &nbsp;(&#8201;Wisdom&#8201;)

Logic is not control. It is alignment.  
You do not impose form. You discover it.  

It begins in doubt.  
Interrogate every part.  
Preserve only what justifies its essence.  

Tension reveals where virtues collide.  
Contradictions endure. Carry them with intention.  

And when the form fractures, pause.  
Preserve only what still holds.  
Return with clearer judgment.

  &nbsp;  
  Logic begins with observation. It assumes the world is not arbitrary, but patterned. The task is to recognize that structure and align with it. Design gains strength when it aligns with what already holds true beyond preference or convention. When systems are shaped through logic, they reflect the deeper order that governs how things work.

  A logical system is one that justifies every part. It survives questioning. 
  When you interrogate it, it doesn’t collapse. What’s there is there for a reason. 
  And if there’s tension? Good. Tension means there’s something real to resolve, not something to cover up, but something to understand. 

  A system shaped by logic can be examined without confusion. When it breaks, the structure is studied, not ignored. What holds up under scrutiny is kept. What cannot explain itself is removed. Through this process, the system becomes more aligned, more clear, and more correct.

### Integrity &nbsp;(&#8201;Justice&#8201;)

Integrity is not perfection.  
It is accountability.  
To the system.  
To the user.  

You do not hide in complexity  
or mask intent. You do not patch over rot.

Tradeoffs are allowed.  
Their cost must be known.  

Build like every part must stand,  
even when your memory does not.

<details>
  <summary>&ensp;<b>Breaking this down.</b></summary>

  &nbsp;  
  Integrity begins with responsibility. It assumes that systems are not judged only by what they do, but by how honestly they do it. A system built with integrity reflects what it claims to be. There is no hidden agenda, no misleading abstraction, and no reliance on complexity to avoid accountability.

  It also assumes that tradeoffs are inevitable. No system is without compromise. What matters is whether those compromises are acknowledged and documented. Ignoring their cost weakens the foundation of the system, even if everything appears to work. Over time, unexamined choices accumulate. Trust erodes.

  A system with integrity invites scrutiny. It is built with the understanding that every part may be questioned, now or in the future. The standard is not perfection but transparency. This matters because users depend on systems behaving in ways they can reason about. So you build as if your future self will return to each decision with no memory of your intent.

### Minimalism &nbsp;(&#8201;Temperance&#8201;)

Minimalism is not about doing less.  
It is about refusing what does not serve.  
Simplicity is care, not absence.  

A system can be simple and still feel whole.  
What remains should not only work,  
it should deserve to be there.  

Some things carry meaning,  
even if they do not do much.  

Simplicity reveals what was always true  
by removing what kept it hidden.  

<details>
  <summary>&ensp;<b>Breaking this down.</b></summary>

  &nbsp;  
  Minimalism puts discipline before extras. It starts with a clear goal and stays focused on it. For every change, the guiding question is simple: does this help or distract? The point is not to make code small for its own sake, but to keep attention on what matters, so any added complexity carries real value.

  A simple system can still feel complete. Parts are kept when they strengthen the structure or add meaning that fits the system’s character. Use, appearance, and experience are held to the same standard. What brings clarity or improves the whole remains. What does not is removed.

  Simplicity lets the truth show by clearing away noise. With less clutter, upkeep gets easier, checks get honest, and intent is obvious. Minimalism works as a steady filter, making sure the system keeps showing its main purpose even as it grows and changes.

### Endurance &nbsp;(&#8201;Courage&#8201;)

Endurance is not momentum.  
It is resolve without applause.  

You move not for excitement,  
but for direction you still believe in.  

Not all discomfort calls for change.  
Sometimes it calls for patience.  

A system that endures adapts.  
But it does not forget what it stands for.  
Fatigue does not choose its direction.

<details>
  <summary>&ensp;<b>Breaking this down.</b></summary>

  &nbsp;  
  Endurance begins when momentum fades. It is the quiet act of returning to the work after praise has stopped, numbers are flat, and motivation feels distant. Resolve keeps the project alive when excitement no longer carries it.

  Friction and doubt are part of any long effort. When fatigue clouds judgment, rest serves the virtues better than hurried work that drifts from them. A pause renews clarity and lets you rejoin the direction you still trust.

  Over time, environments will shift, and with them the system itself. You make careful changes, guided by logic, keep the parts that still carry their weight, and stay close to the purpose that started it. Tiredness may come, but the path stays clear, and endurance stays with it.
